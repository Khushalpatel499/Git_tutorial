# Git_tutorial
## Git-
    1. It is basically a version control system which track changes in code. 
    2. main features: a. track the histroy of code.
                      b. collaborate  
    3. Change in project is two ways in git: 1.add 2.commit  
    4.Git work on system for setup we required: a. A code editor 
                                                b. Window(GitBash) or Mac(Terminal)
    5. git --version : for check the version of git on system.
    6. ls  : differnt directories(files) present.
    7. clear : to clear gitbash.
    8. pwd : working directory(folder).
    9. ~ : show to we are in our main or root directory or primary folder.
    10. Git configure: a.It tell git on which account we are going to commit changes.
                       b.Two types: 1.global 2.local(if you have more than one git account).
                       c. git config --global user.name"githubAccountName"
                       d. git config --global user.email"someone@gmail.com"
                       e. git config --list: to see what we set 
    11. Two Place for changes : 1.remote(ex: github) 2. local(laptop,PC).
    12. Clone -a.To copy any repo form remote to local system.
               b.git clone <--some link-->
    13. cd- change directory which is of two type 
            a. go inside - cd foldername
            b. come outside - cd..  or cd\ -come to main directory
    14. ls -a : to see all files.
    15. Status: display state of code.(git status)
    16. When we have modifiy our file we have to do two step process add and commit.
    17.In git staturs we have 4 types files: a. untracked : new file that git doesn't track
                                             b. modified  : changed in file
                                             c. staged    : file is ready to commit means when any file is modified or untracked file add then we have to add that file that is staged then after we commit.
                                             d. unmodified: no change in file
    
    
    
    
## Github-
    1. A website that allow developers to store and manage their code.
    2. We can upload different repository(repo or folder) on github.  
    3. README.md(readme markdown): We can store the detail about project.
    4. Commit: change we made in our repo which increase the commit each time.
