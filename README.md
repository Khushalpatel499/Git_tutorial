## Git-
    1. It is basically a version control system which track changes in code. 
    2. main features: a. track the histroy of code.
                      b. collaborate  
    3. Change in project is two ways in git: 1.add 2.commit  
    4.Git work on system for setup we required: a. A code editor 
                                                b. Window(GitBash) or Mac(Terminal)

## Github-
    1. A website that allow developers to store and manage their code.
    2. We can upload different repository(repo or folder) on github.
